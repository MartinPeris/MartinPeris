I believe that true success is measured by the number of people that can have a better life because of your existence.

The way I maximize that number is by using my AI and Computer Science skills to solve some of societyâ€™s biggest challenges, like shortage of labor in some industries due to aging population.

I just happen to make awesome robots.
